# KMLCO - Keaton More Like Cleats On

What a stupid name right? Well that's what I was aiming for, otherwise I'm about to get Boomed by Sonic, afterall, this is a special SDK for a dead game of a prestigiously rich and possibly scummy company. (Most companies are, but I have had no prior experience with these guys, and therefore I cannot say)

# What is this project?

*Perhaps* it is an open source project to create private servers for said game, however I am not prioritizing it and cannot guarantee anything will come of it, but here's the SDK with a perfectly working template DLL for the beta build, which you can *cough-cough* ~~find on Archive.org~~.

Which I am not distributing, you can get it yourself.

# Disclaimer

Once more thou shall not call upon thy self a perpetrator, for I am merely but a garbage programmer with the ADHD of a thousand crops, and a sword of mental illness.

***(Translation: I am not responsible for whatever you do with this SDK and DLL, for this alone is a mere tool, which can cause some serious consequences, consequences that I deny to accept the responsibility of.)***
